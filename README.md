# Sudoku-Solver
If you don't know what this is, this is a Sudoku solver implemented in Brainfuck. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that is known for its minamilism, as it uses only eight comands: > < + - . , \[ \]  (for more information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck>)  
With only these i made a program that can solve a Sudoku.

This program is quite complex and REEEEEEALLY long, and at some point i would also like to make a documantation of how it all works.  
I would really appreciate people contributing (especially to make the program more efficient) too, since there are some parts that are contained within themselves.  
Also really sorry if the commits and the merge history is messy, its my first time using Git and GitHub 

---
If you would like to see this program work live i would recomend using the interpreter that i used for running and debbuging.  
Also something to take in mind is that this program is LONG and it can take some time to execute
