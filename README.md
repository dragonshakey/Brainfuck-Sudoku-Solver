# Sudoku-Solver
If you don't know what this is, this is a Sudoku solver implemented in Brainfuck. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that is known for its minamilism, as it uses only eight comands: > < + - . , \[ \]  (for more information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck>)  
With only these i will make a program that can solve a Sudoku.

This program is quite complex and REEEEEEALLY long, and some point i would also like to make a documantation of how it all works.  
I would really appreciate people contributing (especially to make the program more efficient) too, since there are some parts that are contained within themselves.  
Also really sorry if the commits and the merge history is messy, its my first time using Git and GitHub 

Interpreters I use: <https://www.nayuki.io/page/brainfuck-interpreter-javascript>

notes:  
- the program currently works on SOME sudokus i have tested
- SudokuSolver.bf is not updated to the current version
