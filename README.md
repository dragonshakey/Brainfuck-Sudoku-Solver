# Sudoku-Solver
This is by far my most ambitious and the project I worked on the most.  
If you don't know what this is, this is a Sudoku solver implemented in Brainfuck. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that is known for its minamilism, as it uses only eight comands: > < + - . , [ ] (for more information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)  
With only these i will make a program that can solve a Sudoku.

Interpreters I use:

notes:  
- the project itself is not yet functional and does not work  
- SudokuSolver.bf is not updated to the current version
